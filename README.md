# O-Chem-Identifier

## About

Created by David Guest, Danny Nash, Kevin Reisch, and Andrew Bissel. This application enables users to convert hand-drawn organic chemistry molecules into digital copies. Even if the handwriting is challenging to decipher, a machine learning model will adjust it to produce recognizable characters in the final digital copy. The README which will provide instructions and accompanying pictures, will be finalized by 10/4/2023 to guide users in making the application executable on their machine.
